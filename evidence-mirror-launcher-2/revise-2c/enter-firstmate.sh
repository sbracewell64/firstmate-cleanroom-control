# Captain entry point for the clean-room FirstMate environment.
#
# Starts a primary FirstMate session whose CODE comes from the pinned, read-only
# upstream checkout and whose OPERATIONAL HOME is this runtime root, per the
# FM_HOME contract in <code-root>/docs/configuration.md ("FM_HOME").
#
# This file lives in the runtime home on purpose: the upstream checkout is
# pristine and is never written to.
#
# The operational home moved to ext4 (WSL native) on 2026-09-02: drvfs carries
# no file modes, and the upstream watcher registrar requires an exact 0700 on a
# private check script. The code root, the tools and the evidence tree stay on
# E:; only the private mutable runtime lives here.
#
# HERDR ISOLATION (2026-09-02, commission part F). The other FirstMate
# installation on this machine (/home/OPERATOR/kun-agent-workspace) is LIVE and its
# workers occupy Herdr's "default" session. The upstream adapter resolves EVERY
# primary home's workspace label to the constant "firstmate"
# (<code-root>/bin/backends/herdr.sh, fm_backend_herdr_workspace_label) with no
# per-home discriminator, so two primaries sharing one Herdr session would see,
# adopt and scan each other's workspace. The isolation seam is the one the
# upstream mechanism ALREADY reads -- the named Herdr session (HERDR_SESSION;
# fm_backend_herdr_session) -- because a named session is a separate Herdr
# server with its own socket and its own workspace list, so the constant label
# cannot collide. No upstream file is patched. The durable value lives in
# config/herdr-session and THIS script is its only reader.
#
# CAPTAIN CONSOLE INSIDE HERDR (2026-09-02, control issue #3 comment 2, launcher
# UX ruling). Invoked outside Herdr (the Desktop shortcut), this script now:
#   1. validates every identity below and REFUSES rather than degrading;
#   2. drops any FOREIGN Herdr ancestry (a pane of another session) so the
#      launch can never adopt the legacy session;
#   3. starts the dedicated named Herdr session's server if it is not running;
#   4. finds this home's ONE console workspace (label "firstmate") in that
#      session, or creates it and types `enter-firstmate.sh --console` into its
#      root pane (no worker is spawned to build the UI);
#   5. attaches the Herdr TUI to that session in the current console window.
# Invoked with --console (only ever by step 4, inside the clean-room session's
# own pane) it re-validates and execs the harness in place. Closing the TUI
# window leaves the server and the console running; the next click re-attaches.
#
# NO-MISTAKES ISOLATION (2026-09-02, control issue #3 no_mistakes ruling). The
# clean-room never attaches to the shared legacy no-mistakes daemon/root
# (~/.no-mistakes, served by a v1.40.3 daemon for the live fleet). Upstream
# no-mistakes documents NM_HOME as the supported relocation selector
# (tools/no-mistakes/docs/.../reference/environment.md: "everything else moves
# under this root", including socket, PID, lock, database and worktrees, with a
# per-root managed-service suffix). This launcher exports
# NM_HOME=<FM_HOME>/no-mistakes for the console and therefore every worker,
# asserts the resolved client is the clean-room pinned binary at/above the
# upstream floor, and ensures that root's own daemon is running. It REFUSES to
# start a console whose NM_HOME would resolve to the shared root.
#
# TOOLS. The clean-room tools surface (<tools>/bin) is PATH[0], asserted; the
# effective tool policy (ABSENT / PRESENT_BELOW_FLOOR / QUALIFIED, floors
# projected from the pinned upstream) is rendered by <tools>/tool-policy.sh and
# printed by the doctor. The repair path is always the clean-room-scoped
# tools/pin-axi-tools.sh, never a host-global install.
#
# COLD-START SUPERVISION ARM (2026-09-03, control issue #8 REVISE). Architecture
# law: a fresh FirstMate session with registered supervision sources must be
# supervised BEFORE the first model turn, and cognition is never the startup
# trigger for infrastructure. The watcher's between-turn owner (the Claude Stop
# asyncRewake hook, <code-root>/bin/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.sh) runs inside the
# console's own process group: it dies with the console, and after a relaunch
# nothing re-arms it until a human sends a message (observed: the hook's arm
# output showed `watcher: started ... (beacon fresh)` followed by `Terminated
# sleep "$POLL"`). This launcher therefore arms supervision itself, in
# --console mode, AFTER FM_HOME/config/session identity are resolved and BEFORE
# the harness is exec'd, by launching ONE detached owner process
# (`enter-firstmate.sh --arm-owner`, internal) that:
#   1. re-derives the same gates the Stop hook applies (bin/fm-supervision-lib.sh
#      need, state/.afk, session lock liveness from bin/fm-session-lock-lib.sh);
#   2. claims the next auto-arm generation in the SAME epoch ledger the Stop hook
#      uses (state/.claude-autoarm-epoch via fm_autoarm_claim_next), so the first
#      Stop after the first turn defers to it instead of arming a duplicate;
#   3. runs the canonical arm bin/fm-watch-arm.sh in its FOREGROUND (never `&`),
#      which starts the watcher singleton or attaches to a live one and prints
#      exactly one `watcher: started|attached|FAILED` line;
#   4. when the cycle closes with an actionable reason, delivers that reason to
#      the console pane as a typed `watcher`-kind operational input
#      (bin/fm-operational-input.sh, the same envelope the away daemon and the
#      OpenCode wake plugin use) through the backend's composer-guarded submit
#      core, then commits `rewake` in the ledger so the next Stop takes the next
#      generation. Nothing turns a queued wake into a model turn otherwise.
# The owner runs under setsid with stdio detached (state/cold-start-arm.log), so
# it outlives this shell's exec into the harness and the console's exit; the
# next launch then attaches to its watcher instead of starting a second one.
# The launcher waits for the arm line plus a verified fresh beacon
# (fm_watcher_healthy) before exec, bounded by FM_ENTRY_ARM_TIMEOUT (default
# 40s). Supervision required but unverifiable: the console starts VISIBLY
# DEGRADED with a loud banner (the session-start digest's guard alarm and the
# first Stop's auto-arm are the existing recovery), except an unwritable
# state/ which is refused outright because no lock, beacon, or ledger could be
# recorded. --doctor reports the whole posture and still starts nothing.
#
# CONSOLE LAUNCH CONTRACT AND STALE RESUME (2026-09-03, control issue #8
# REVISE 2, after live relaunch 1 FAILED at 21:16Z). Herdr persists each pane's
# Claude session id (source herdr:claude, reported by its own Claude SessionStart
# hook) and, when its server restarts, its native resume-on-restore types
# `claude --resume <id>` into the restored pane BEFORE this launcher can act
# (global config.toml `[session] resume_agents_on_restore`, default true).
# Observed: the persisted id was stale, Claude exited with `No conversation
# found`, the console pane sat at a bare shell, and this launcher still reported
# the recorded pane as `existing`, because "the pane exists" was its entire
# liveness predicate. The repair keeps ONE owner (this file), adds no session
# store and no second resume registry:
#   * --console owns resume. The candidate id is Herdr's own pane record, or an
#     explicit --resume passed by the convergence path below. It is resumed only
#     when Claude's native session store holds that transcript, and the harness
#     runs as this shell's FOREGROUND CHILD so `--resume` success is OBSERVED:
#     a resume that exits non-zero within FM_ENTRY_RESUME_WINDOW seconds falls
#     back exactly once to a fresh session with the identical canonical argv
#     (same harness, style settings, permission policy, environment, and the
#     supervision arm already verified above it). A failing fresh launch exits
#     loudly; --console never returns to an interactive shell as a nominal
#     successful startup.
#   * The Desktop launch classifies the recorded console pane by its OBSERVED
#     foreground (herdr pane process-info, plus the upstream idle-shell proof)
#     against the console record's console_pid: canonical (the harness whose
#     parent is the --console shell) -> reuse; a bare idle shell -> the console
#     contract is typed into that pane again (bounded, once per two minutes);
#     a harness this launcher did not start -> when THIS launch started the
#     server (Herdr's restore is then the only possible author) it is exited
#     with the harness's own exit command through the upstream verified submit
#     core and relaunched canonically with the SAME session id, otherwise it is
#     left untouched and reported loudly (never typed into).
# Every launch decision is one line in state/console-launch.log, fields in the
# console record, and a block in the doctor's "captain console" section.
# Live relaunch 3 (22:51Z) showed a THIRD seam, in delivery rather than launch:
# an auto-arm generation owned by a Stop-hook auto-arm (bin/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.sh)
# from the PRE-relaunch harness incarnation survived the server stop and stayed
# healthy. cold_arm_ensure saw an open, healthy claim and chose defer-open-claim,
# trusting that owner to deliver its close "to this console". But a Stop-hook
# auto-arm delivers ONLY by exit-2 rewake into ITS OWN harness, which the relaunch
# had already killed; the captured wake was queued and never typed into the new
# console (L7 FAIL, control #8). The rule: at cold-start (this incarnation has
# taken zero turns) only a LIVE cold-start arm-owner - which delivers by typing a
# watcher-kind operational input into the composer - can deliver here. A Stop-hook
# or dead/foreign owner is stale-for-this-console; the launcher supersedes that
# generation (cold_arm_supersede_stale) and arms its own typed-delivery owner,
# which attaches to the still-healthy watcher rather than starting a second one.
# Live relaunch 2 (21:50Z) showed the timing that the inline classification
# cannot see: a headless Herdr server evaluates its restore at start but SPAWNS
# the restored console pane's terminal only when a TUI client attaches (server
# log: `client connected` then `pane.spawn.start` 13 s after startup), and this
# launcher attaches LAST (`exec herdr --session`). The inline convergence saw an
# unreadable pane for its whole settle window and left it; the native resume
# then ran unopposed. So when THIS launch started the server, the convergence
# is delegated to ONE detached owner (`--converge-owner`, the arm owner's
# setsid idiom) that waits for the pane to materialize after the attach, lets
# the restore settle, and applies exactly the same classification and actions.
#
# HARNESS PERMISSION POLICY (2026-09-03, control issue #7 ruling 3, explicit
# captain authorization; applied in the recovery session after the live proof).
# The primary console launches Claude with --dangerously-skip-permissions on
# every start, resume, and fallback. The policy owner is the permission_policy_*
# block below (this launcher), consumed by the --console argv composer, asserted
# on the composed argv before launch (launch-byte watched red), and rendered by
# the doctor. Worker and secondmate harnesses keep the upstream spawn compiler's
# own equivalents (<code-root>/bin/fm-spawn.sh launch templates); this file only
# READS that file to prove each expected token is still present (drift watched
# red) and never duplicates a flag into a spawn. The policy removes interactive
# approval prompts only: FirstMate authority, merge and landing rules, gates,
# validators, and credential handling are untouched, and machine-global harness
# settings are never written.
